Control how published content is updated. Users can duplicate posts and submit changes. Then editors can approve, reject or schedule those changes.

== Description ==

PublishPress Revisions is the ultimate tool for making content changes. Users get a safe space to work on content updates. When the changes are ready, they can ask for approval to publish the update. Administrators can approve or reject the changes. They can also schedule them to go live in the future.

Your users can update posts using the normal WordPress editor, but their changes will not be published automatically. Instead, the changes are stored in a "Revision Queue". The changes can be approved, rejected or scheduled. PublishPress Revisions works with the familiar WordPress interface, including Gutenberg and the Classic Editor.

## PublishPress Revisions Pro ##

## Submit Change Requests for Posts ####
PublishPress Revisions allows your users to submit change requests for published posts. Your users can update posts using the normal WordPress editor, but their changes will not be published automatically. Instead, the changes are stored as a "pending revision" that can be approved or rejected.

## Schedule Future Updates to Posts ##

PublishPress Revisions allows you to schedule WordPress revisions to be published in the future. When you're editing a published post, all you need to do is select a future date and click "Schedule Revision". Your changes will be published at the specified time.

[Click here to see how to schedule revisions](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/schedule-revisions-future/).

## Manage and Moderate Changes to Content ##

After you create a revision with PublishPress Revisions, you can find that revision on the Revision Queue screen. This screen shows you all the revisions that have been submitted for approval. Underneath each duplicate post you can choose from several moderation tools: Edit, Delete, Preview and Compare.

[Click here to see how to manage and moderate revisions](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/schedule-or-publish-revisions/).

## Compare Current and Former Versions ##
Pending and Scheduled Revisions can include changes to post content, categories, tags, featured image, page parent and other options. Each of these changes can be reviewed in the familiar Compare Revisions interface.

[Click here to see how to compare revisions](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/compare-revisions/).

## Frontend Moderation of Content Changes ##

It is possible to preview and moderate revisions via the frontend of your WordPress site. If you click Preview for a pending revision, you'll see a toolbar across the frontend of the site. This toolbar will change color so you can easily know the status of the revision. For example, if you're looking at a pending revision, the toolbar will be green. For scheduled revisions, the toolbar will be grey.

[Click here to see how to manage from the frontend of your site](https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/publishing-revisions-frontend/).

## Email Notifications for Revisions ##

PublishPress Revisions will notify Administrators and Editors when a new revision is submitted. They can log in to preview, compare and approve the changes. PublishPress Revisions can also send emails for revision approval and publication. The Settings screen lets you disable unwanted notifications.

## You Can Set Very Detailed Revision Permissions ##

PublishPress Revisions works with the default WordPress user roles, and also introduces a Revisor role:

* Contributors can submit revisions to their own published posts.
* Revisors can submit revisions to posts and pages published by others.
* Authors, Editors and Administrators can approve revisions or schedule their own revisions.

To schedule changes to a published post, just set the desired future date before hitting Update.

By upgrading to Revisions Pro, you also gain advanced permissions control through the PublishPress Permissions Pro plugin. You can customize permissions by role or per-user, granting full editing or revision submission rights to specific posts, categories, or taxonomy terms.
